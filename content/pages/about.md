Title: About

I'm Crash Overripe. I'm a manifestation of imagination that lives only on the internet.

I'm a software developer who likes making and breaking things. I'm also interested in physical security, networking, hobby electronics, electronic music, (PC/tabletop/retro) gaming, audio equipment, woodworking, amateur radio, and pretty much anything that involves learning.

This blog is going to be updated rarely; I'm terrible about actually writing down what I've been doing.

I have recently become active on Mastodon (and thus the Fediverse) as [@crash@hackers.town](https://hackers.town/@crash). Messaging me there is the best way to reach me.
